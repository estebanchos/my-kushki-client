        title: 'How to Make a Budget',
        intro: "What is a budget?\nBudgeting means creating a plan to track your spending and categorize those expenses. A budget is like a road map for your finances. It shows you where to go and what limitations you need to set for yourself.\nWithout a budget, it’s easy to spend more than you earn and go into debt. It’s also harder to prioritize major savings goals if you don’t know where your money is going. People who don’t have a budget can find it harder to pay off debt, save for retirement, or achieve milestones like buying a house.",

        copy: 'If you break it down, a budget is actually a pretty simple equation. You look at what comes in versus what comes out, and want to ensure that what goes out is less than what comes in.\n1. Figure out how much comes in\nGather your paychecks and calculate the net income (the amount you have left after taxes) to see how much money you’re taking home per month. If you’re a freelancer, that part’s a bit trickier. Collect all your invoices from the past year and add them up to see how much you’ve been making on average per month. If you don’t expect your contracts to change too wildly, go off of that monthly estimate. You’ll also have to factor in any taxes you might owe at the end of the tax year.\n2. Figure out how much you’re spending every month (fixed expenses)\nMake a list of all of your monthly bills: rent, any subscription services like Netflix or Spotify, water, electricity, gas, mortgage payments, car payments, your phone bill, health insurance, gym membership, etc. These are also known as “fixed” expenses, or expenses that you have to pay every month and that usually stay about the same.\n3. Identify your variable expenses\nThese are expenses that aren’t necessarily fixed and aren’t necessary for keeping a roof over your head and the lights on. These are also known as “fun” expenses: money you spend on clothes, dinners out, happy hour drinks, trips, theatre and movie visits, grocery trip visits, and so forth. Depending on your lifestyle, this one might hurt a little to confront.\n4. Add up expenses, and compare to income\nHere’s where the simple math comes in. If your expenses are higher than your income (or you’re barely breaking even), it’s time to budget!'
